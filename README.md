## About

"DSC Force Graph" is a website that displays information as a graph with interconnected nodes. Each node in the graph represents a lesson or exercise and has a note attached to it to save additional information. The nodes are connected to each other to represent the relationships between the lessons or exercises. The tool uses a force-directed graph layout to arrange the nodes, making it visually appealing and easy to navigate.

## Features
- A graphical representation of lessons or exercises and their relationships
- Attach notes to each node in the graph
- A force-directed graph layout that makes it visually appealing and easy to navigate
- Add, edit, and delete nodes and their associated notes
- The ability to zoom in and out and pan around the graph for better viewing.
- A search function to quickly find specific nodes in the graph (Upcoming)
- The ability to export and save the graph as an image or other file format (Upcoming)
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices and screen sizes (Upcoming)
