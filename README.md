## About

"DSC Force Graph" is a website that displays information as a graph with interconnected nodes. Each node in the graph represents a lesson or exercise and has a note attached to it to save additional information. The nodes are connected to each other to represent the relationships between the lessons or exercises. The tool uses a force-directed graph layout to arrange the nodes, making it visually appealing and easy to navigate.
